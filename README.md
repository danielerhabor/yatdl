## yatdl (Yet Another To Do List)
This is is a to do list that has been on my mind for while

The key features I am trying to implement are as follows:

- The user should be able to add tasks where each task has a task name, task description, created date and time, modified date and time, a pomodoro (more on this later), and total amount of time spent on the task.
